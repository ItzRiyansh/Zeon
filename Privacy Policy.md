## **What information is stored?**

Only message content is stored.

## Why it is stored?
We store only _**message content**_ for `snipe` command, which is used to fetch deleted message from a guild channel (only if you're in the same channel).

## How it is stored?
We don't use any database for it. We just store it in internal cache memory of the bot.

## Who can see my data?
Since it is stored in internal cache memory of bot, no one can see it until someone uses `snipe` command to view deleted message in that specific guild channel.

## How can I delete my Data?
Well, since we're not using any database, it's stored in internal cache memory of bot, so practically not possible to "delete". But you can contact me & I will disable storing of message content & snipe command in your server.
